# Q4 - Feature engineering II

The NHL data contains rich information that allows complex features to be engineered. Here's a list of features implemented with a short description:

1. **seconds_elapsed**: Total number of seconds of game time. Takes the current period time in seconds + 1200 seconds per regular period completed + 300 or 1200 seconds per overtime period completed (to account for playoff vs. regular season games)
2. **game_period_idx**: Index of the current period, starting at 1. Period index above 3 indicate overtime.
3. **x_coord**: X coordinate on the ice rink in foot. Ranges from -100 to 100
4. **y_coord**: Y coordinate on the ice rink in foot. Range from -43 to 43
3. **x_coord_norm**: Change the sign of the X coordinate to have all offensive plays on the positive range of x-values
4. **y_coord_norm**: Change the sign of the Y coordinate to maintain the relative position to the net. This ensure correct handedness of shots.
5. **dist_from_net**: Distance between the normalized (x, y)  coordinates of the shot, and the normalized goal at (89, 0). It is the L2 norm of the vector between the two points.
6. **angle_from_net**: Angle between (x, y) coordinates, and the goal middle line (x, 0). When facing the goal, positive values represent the right side, and negative values the left side. Values between [0, 90] and [-90, 0] indicate the front of the goal, and those between [90, 180] and [-90, -180] behind the goal. 
7. **shot_type**: Shot type of the current event. The categories were one-hot encoded (Backhand, Slap shot, Snap Shot, Tip-In, Wrap-around, Wrist Shot, Deflected).
8. **empty_net**: Boolean indicating if the net was empty at the time of the shot. The data is missing for the majority of examples. The data field included information about Powerplay, and Shorthanded goals, leading to data leakage in the model (i.e., it is correlated with the label).
9. **previous_event_type**: The type of the previous recorded event. Masked to assure the previous event happened during the same game period. The categories were one-hot encoded (BLOCKED_SHOT, FACEOFF, GIVEAWAY, HIT, MISSED_SHOT, SHOT, TAKEAWAY).
10. **previous_x_coord**: X coordinate of the previous event. Masked to assure theprevious event happened during the same game period.
11. **previous_y_coord**: Y coordinate of the previous event. Masked to assure the previous event happened during the same game period.
12. **seconds_from_previous**: Total number of seconds of  game time since last event. Masked to assure the previous event happened during the same game period.
13. **dist_from_previous**: Distance between (x, y) coordinates of the current and previous events. Masked to assure the previous event happened during the same game period.
14. **rebound**: Boolean indicating if the shot was a rebound. A rebound happens when the previous event was also a shot by the same team. Masked to assure the previous event happened during the same game period.
15. **angle_change**: If the current event is a rebound, indicates the difference of angle between the two shots; otherwise 0.
16. **speed**: Distance from the previous event divided by the seconds from previous event. It should be noted that Faceoffs, or penalty shots involve stopping the game time, and repositioning players. This can give the impression of large distances being crossed in a short amount of time.
