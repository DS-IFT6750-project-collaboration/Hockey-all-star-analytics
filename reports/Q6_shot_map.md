# Q6. Advanced Visualizations: Shot Maps

> Discuss (in a few sentences) what you can interpret from these plots.



> Consider the Colorado Avalanche; take a look at their shot map during the 2016-17 season. Discuss what you could say about the team during this season. Now look at the shot map for the Colorado Avalanche for the 2020-21 season, and discuss what you could conclude from these differences. Does this make sense? Hint: look at the standings.

The shot maps of the Colorado Avalanche for the 2016-2017 and the 2020-2021 seasons greatly differ. Indeed, in 2016-2017, they placed 30th out of 30 teams in the league, and in 2020-2021, they placed 1st place out of 31 teams.

In 2016-2017, they appear largely below the league average for close range shots. First, the less shots taken, the less chances to score. Second, the low proportion of close range shots compared to the league suggests that their offence struggled heavily to approach the net.

The plot for 2020-2021 tells the opposite story. They appear above the league average for almost the whole ice rink, especially near the goal. This suggests that they were able to takes more frequently than most teams, and that had a strong offence able to keep pressure on its opponents. 

> Consider the Buffalo Sabres, which have been a team that has struggled over recent years, and compare them to the Tampa Bay Lightning, a team which has won the Stanley for the past two years in a row. Look at the shot maps for these two teams from the 2018-19, 2019-20, and 2020-21 seasons. Discuss what observations you can make. Is there anything that could explain the Lightning’s success, or the Sabres’ struggles? How complete of a picture do you think this paints?
